# Ovarian Tumor Classification

This repository contains code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on classifying different types of ovarian tumors from medical data (e.g., ultrasound images, clinical features, or combined modalities).

## üìå Problem Statement

Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection and accurate classification of ovarian tumors (benign, borderline, or malignant) are critical for effective treatment planning. The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that can assist clinicians by automatically identifying the type of ovarian tumor based on input data.

## üéØ Objectives

- Preprocess clinical or imaging data related to ovarian tumors.
- Train classification models to distinguish between:
  - **Benign tumors**
  - **Borderline tumors**
  - **Malignant tumors**
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Provide an explainable and robust model for real-world use.

## üìÅ Dataset

> *Note: You can replace this section with actual dataset details.*

- **Source:** Publicly available dataset / Hospital database (please specify).
- **Features:** May include imaging data (e.g., ultrasound), patient age, CA-125 levels, tumor size, etc.
- **Labels:** Each sample is labeled as `Benign`, `Borderline`, or `Malignant`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure




## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning missing values
   - Feature normalization/scaling
   - Image preprocessing (if applicable)

2. **Model Selection**
   - Baseline: Logistic Regression / SVM
   - Advanced: Random Forest, XGBoost, or Deep Learning (CNN for images)

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision / Recall / F1-score
   - ROC-AUC
   - Confusion Matrix
