# Ovarian Tumor Segmentation

This repository contains code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on classifying different types of ovarian tumors from medical data (e.g., ultrasound images, clinical features, or combined modalities).

## üìå Problem Statement

Automatic ovarian tumor segmentation in ultrasound imaging is essential for supporting early diagnosis and effective treatment. Although some significant progress has been made, this problem still faces challenges due to strong variability and unclear boundaries of ovarian tumors. To address the first issue, this study proposes a framework, namely CSA-SegNet (Combined Spatial Pooling with Attention for Ovarian Tumor Segmentation Network).

## üéØ Objectives

- Preprocess clinical or imaging data related to ovarian tumors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure






## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning missing values
   - Feature normalization/scaling
   - Image preprocessing (if applicable)

2. **Model Selection**
   
   - Advanced: Deep Learning (CNN for images)

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision / Recall / F1-score
   - Dice, IoU
   - HD
